# AI LEARNING 

## Month 1 -- AI Basics for Developers
 ### Learn how to use prebuilt AI APIs:
  - OpenAI (chat, embeddings)
  - Hugging Face inference API
  - Replicate.com for image/audio models
 ### Build small tools:
  - AI text summarizer (REST API -> Nuxt frontend)
  - AI image generator (Stable diffusion API -> Vue app)

 ## Month 2 -- Renning AI Models Locally
  - Learn to use Hugging Face Transformers locally.
  - Use GPU on Colab to run open-source models.
  - Build a local text classification tool for your own data.
  - Learn how to save & load models for reuse

 ## Month 3 -- Fine-Tuning Models
  - Take an existing model and customize it:
    - Fine-tune LLaMA or mBERT for Bengali text tasks.
    - Fine-tune a TTS model (Coqui) for a specific voice.
  - Learn data cleaning, tokenization, and basic evaluation.

 ### Month 4 -- Deployment Skills
  - Learn FastAPI or Flask to create inference APIs.
  - Dockerize and deploy to VPS or cloud (Hetzner, AWS, Railway)
  - Integrate the deployed AI API into web & mobile apps.

 ### Month 5 -- Multi-Modal AI Apps
  - Combine different AI types:
    - LLM + Image (chatbot that can also generate images)
    - Text -> Speach, Speect -> Text
  - Example: Bookspointer AI reading assistant (reads aloud + explains difficult words)

 ### Month 6 -- Capstone Project
  - Build and deploy a full production AI app:
    - Example
        - Bengali AI audiobook generator -- upload text, get downloadable audio
        - AI search assistant for your books (semantic + keyword search)
  - Make it public, polish UI/UX, and showcase it in portfolio
